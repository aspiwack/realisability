* Simple types

** Simply typed λ-calculus

 Assume a set $I$ of individuals

 $$
 u,v ::= λx.u | u v | i ∈ I
 a,b ::= ι | a → b
 $$

 Typing rules
 $$
 Γ,x:a ⊢ u : b
 -------------
 Γ ⊢ λx. u : a → b

 Γ ⊢ u : a → b   Γ ⊢ v : a
 -------------------------
 Γ ⊢ u v : b

 ----------
 Γ ⊢ i : ι
 $$

** Operational semantics

Given by a Krivine machine

$$
π ::= ∙ | u ⋅ π
c ::= u ⋆ π
$$

$$
u v ⋆ π ~> u ⋆ v ⋅ π
λx. u ⋆ v ⋅ π ~> u[v] ⋆ π
$$

** Realisability model
Let $T$ be the set of closed terms, $Π$ the set of (closed) stacks and
$C$ the set of commands

Fix a pole $⊥ ∈ 𝒫(C)$. The model is parametrised by this pole.

Define acceptors as sets of stacks and realisers as sets of terms
$$
|a → b| ∈ 𝒫(Π)
|a → b| ≜ ||a|| ⋅ |b|

|ι| ∈ 𝒫(Π)
|ι| ≜ I^⊥

||a|| ∈ 𝒫(C)
||a|| ≜ |a|^⊥
$$

*** TODO Define orthogonals

** Adequation

We will say that a sequent $x_1:a1,…,x_n:a_n ⊢ u : b$ is /adequat/ if

$$
∀ v_1∈||a_1||, …, v_n∈||a_n||. u[v_1,…,v_n] ∈ ||b||
$$

Our goal is to show that every derivable sequent is adequat. In
particular, for closed terms, that:
$$
⊢ u : b ⟹ u ∈ ||b||
$$

This is not a composable property. It can be, however, strengthened to
a property which we will be able to compose. Namely that all the
typing rules are adequat.
g
gThis can be phrased as /all typing rule preserve adequacy of
sequents/. In other words: if all premises are adequat then the
conclusion is adequat.
s
We need to prove
$$
(∀ x_1∈||a_1||, …, x_n∈||a_n||, x∈||a||. u ∈ ||b||) ⟹ (∀ x_1∈||a_1||, …, x_n∈||a_n||. λx. u ∈ ||a → b||)
(∀ x_1∈||a_1||, …, x_n∈||a_n||. u ∈ ||a → b||) ∧ (∀ x_1∈||a_1||, …, x_n∈||a_n||. v ∈ ||a||) ⟹ (∀ x_1∈||a_1||, …, x_n∈||a_n||. u v ∈ ||b||)
∀ x_1∈||a_1||, …, x_n∈||a_n||. i∈||ι||
